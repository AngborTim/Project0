# Project 0

"Backyard hens" project.
In this project I've tried to organize an information I have about raising chickens. I've grouped all information in three files plus index.
index.html - main page with small intro;
incubator.html - how to make your own incubator;
brooder.html - haw to make brooder - a box where young chicks will stay about one month;
hens.html - when you have adult hens, you can eat eggs :) Small guide and "tips&tricks".
